### **1. What Data Do We Collect?**  
The **Disco Dance** bot collects the following data to ensure functionality:  

#### **Core Data:**  
- **Server IDs (guild_id)** and **User IDs (user_id)** — for level systems, voice activity tracking, statistics, and settings.  
- **Language Preferences** — server-specific language settings (defaults to server locale).  

#### **Activity Statistics:**  
- **Messages:**  
  - Number of messages sent (content is **not** stored).  
  - Mentions of other users (only the fact of mention, no context).  
- **Voice Activity:**  
  - Time spent in voice channels (in seconds).  
  - Channels where users were active.  

#### **Music Data:**  
- **Current track and queue** — temporarily stored in RAM and cleared on bot restart.  
- **Playback history** — **not** retained.  

#### **Additional Data:**  
- **Command usage** (e.g., `/play`, `/volume`) — for bot optimization.
