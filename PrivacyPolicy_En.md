# **Privacy Policy**  
*Last Updated: 04/27/2025*  

### **1. What Data Do We Collect?**  
The bot **does not store** the content of user messages. We only collect:  
- **Server IDs (guild_id)** and **User IDs (user_id)** â€” for leveling systems, voice activity, and language settings.  
- **Activity Statistics**:  
  - Message count (for the leveling system).  
  - Time spent in voice channels (in seconds).  
  - Language preferences (ru/en) for each server.  
- **Music Data**:  
  - Current track, playback queue (temporarily stored in RAM).  

### **2. How Is the Data Used?**  
- To operate bot features:  
  - Leveling system (XP for messages and voice activity).  
  - Leaderboards (`/leaderboard`).  
  - Personalized profile cards (`/rank`).  
  - Language settings (`/language`).  
- Data **is not shared** with third parties or used for advertising.  

### **3. Where Is the Data Stored?**  
- Locally in SQLite databases (`levels.db`, `server.db`).  
- Music playback data is stored temporarily and deleted upon bot restart.  

### **4. How to Delete Your Data?**  
- Contact the developer on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/mHhvMNhFrV) with a deletion request.
